As an extension of the basic I/O, it is worth mentioning one custom method for I/O,
processing connections/strings directly. The value is sometimes data is either so messy, or very large but in a format that `readr` and `data.table` won't handle, so you must default to the default slow methods. This technique allows one to manually
output.
