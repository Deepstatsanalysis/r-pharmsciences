# Custom I/O

As an extension of the basic I/O, it is worth mentioning one custom method for I/O,
processing connections/strings directly. The value is sometimes data is either so messy, or very large but in a format that `readr` and `data.table` won't handle, so you must default to the default slow methods. This technique allows one to manually parse output and clean it up so it is useable by read_csv or another parser. For example, nonmem simulation tables give the following output when simulating with multiple NSUB

```
TABLE NO. 1
 REP ID TIME DV ...
  1  1  0.0  . ...
  1  1  0.25 0.5 ...
  ...
TABLE NO. 1
 REP ID TIME DV ...
  2  1  0.0  . ...
  2  1  0.25 0.3 ...
```
